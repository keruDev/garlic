Garlic is a UI library that aims to provide the necessary components to build
your own recipe cookbook.

## Project

Garlic is a TSX monorepo where you'll find the following:
- `app`: a simple Next app that serves as a demo of the components.
- `@garlic/ui`: the components live here.
- `@garlic/types`: used to specify the data type components will receive via props.
